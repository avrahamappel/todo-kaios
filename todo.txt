TODO

[x] figure out why it ain't loading in firefox and kaios browser
    [x] ancient firefox might not be working with my GPU
    [x] kaois also doesn't support async/await (although the OS itself might)
        [x] confirmed that static page works in KaiOS browser (and looks mighty nice)
    [ ] MAybe it's time to pull in rollup
[ ] Add hook to trunk that adds shims to html
[ ] maybe comment out the `wasm.__wbindgen_start();` part
    [ ] maybe only for shim
